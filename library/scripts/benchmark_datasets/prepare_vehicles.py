"""Download and prepare the 'vehicles' benchmark dataset (large / automotive).

Downloads the Roboflow-100 "Vehicles" dataset from its public HuggingFace
mirror and exports it in the experimental Datumaro format for detection
benchmarks. The dataset contains road-scene images annotated with bounding
boxes across a dozen vehicle types (cars, buses, trucks of various sizes),
making it a large multi-class on-road detection benchmark.
