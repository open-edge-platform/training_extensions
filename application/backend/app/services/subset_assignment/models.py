        Convert split ratios to absolute fold sizes based on total items

        Each fold is guaranteed to receive at least 1 item. Fold sizes are calculated by rounding proportional
        allocations. If the sum differs from total_items due to rounding, the difference is adjusted by adding/removing
        items from folds in order of their ratio size (largest first).
        When ratios are equal, priority is: val > train > test.
